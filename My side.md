I have a discord server with classmates in it, we have some of 8th and some of 7th.

Recently within the past few days, there have been some fits and disagreements between me and others. I am not asking you to side with me, this is just how I see the problem. The last thing I want is a physical fight or trauma for them, and out of honesty, I know what I did was absolutely unneeded.

I realize that I went to die on a hill over an argument that cost me both my long-time friend and my new friends. I find that being fair is not always what people want when it affects them directly, and even so I now know that I cannot be easily forgiven. 

There are a few things I want to clarify:

\1. Many people here started doing the trend of going by they/them instead of their biological address. I had a personal problem of mixing they and them for a group instead of a specific person, if you do not have this problem then that is even better for your understanding, but know what I'm getting at here if you might have this problem.

\2. Gianna does not go by Gianna anymore, it is their [deadname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming), they prefer to be called Gigi. I learned this as of the 30th.
\3. I am not a transphobic person, however I am temporarily neutral about the situation because I want to know everything about what's going on first before I make a set in stone opinion.

For example: People were saying that Obama was a terrorist because he was sending squads to the middle east to kill children. While this was true, the intention wasn't: the terrorists used children as human meat shields for protection, not knowing the whole story gets you mixed up. (My dad said this but even if the event didn't happen, my point still stands.)

yes because not having an opinion means you're neutral. you cannot just be "not transphobic" you have to be anti transphobic

Like I said, temporary, but if it truly makes me a transphobic person, I suppose any toddler that doesn't know anything about the situation or less the word transphobia is transphobic. (Which to me, it doesn't make sense.


I'll start with where the climb really started.


This started on the 17th.
Mackenzie shared that [Gigi was being harrassed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r_oukOTAySg3Iu9s0OSGbC0_6F2FCPq1/view?usp=sharing), I put in my opinion - that I know where they're (as in the opposing person) coming from - but Mackenzie didn't let me finish. [This was my full statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10464lxdHfuwswnYhkGdzcgZ-FKv_1WPA/view?usp=sharing). Later on, the 7th graders wanted to join the server, I saw no wrong in there so I welcomed them in. (They wanted to join the server mainly because I implemented a fake economy of potatoes.)

Now I should say this: the person who was harassing Gigi was a student at the school previously as a 6th grader, for now we'll just address him by his username (yosh) and not by his real name.

The 7th graders asked if Yosh could join the server, I already knew that he was an offensive person, but I said as long as he's following the rules and not being a bully to others in the server he would be fine. I wanted to give him a fair chance, but this soon became to me a mistake I made. Many people on the server wanted him to be removed, but I reasoned with my ignorance for fairness that wasn't needed to be held. Gigi went on and started to call Yosh tranphobic, which translates to [encouraging him to kill himself](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pfnNn5w1-w4eoHydKE3OJDucN63p9WEV/view?usp=sharing). I told them to stop, but they refused, accordingly I had to remove them from the chat. Yosh didn't break the important rules of the server, mostly it was just him either spamming or sending NSFW content in the wrong channel. But still, people we're constantly telling me to remove him, but after a while I got sick of it and removed him in the end. I asked my best friend where I went wrong and they said this:

If someone’s being trouble they just gotta go
Especially in servers like that

I failed to realize both the community of the server and the size of it, there was no reason why he needed to stay longer than he already did. Gigi left the server after I allowed them back in the chat, I apologized the following day and they forgave me, I assume they were truly fine with it since we had lunch together and had a laugh.

After a few days, Gigi asked if the server could have a dedicated channel to yelling at people (bullying others), I refused and stated that I am not encouraging others to bully them on the server, I also asked why not just do it in direct messages. They didn't give me the response that I was looking for; using "i got muted" as the reason why it should be. Giving me the same [excuse](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pfnNn5w1-w4eoHydKE3OJDucN63p9WEV/view?usp=sharing), I say that [people can change](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sWIjhNJ_jr-0YeqgKuw61_ldVFbkwqU8/view?usp=sharing). A classmate said this:

People have dehumanized their enemies in wars for a long time, even though they are still people the same as you. Opinions are not you, they are something you can swap at any time.

Gigi never saw this because they left the guild already. I go ask them in direct messages and they [change the subject](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10ej21P6qVZCrte0FqhhIEIS9wFkHkyvp/view?usp=sharing). Again later on, [they accuse me of being a transphobe and misgendering them on purpose](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gKGOf_0ltj8pkYC3OamjfFES4JX3kc_1/view?usp=sharing). Gigi then tells me they are offended by people using the word-you-use-to-describe-a-bundle-of-sticks word even though [they themselves use it on other people as a joking matter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EOXqDF6iBnsAAVOiUg3RFQQoaqxecwEI/view?usp=sharing) - I was using the word to prove my point. I assume they use the F-word among themselves and then accuse me/us of using the word using their political  marginalization as a shield or excuse as to why it offends them.


Mackenzie shared that they hated men, I stayed quiet for a while until they openly asked others about it. I asked and they (Mackenzie goes by they/them, however biologically female) provided many screenshots of them ranting to Israel about it. When I read their reasons I quickly became infuriated and I realized that it would be improper of me to respond with the same attitude. After the day was over, I write more or less an essay about why I think it is unfair for them to hate men, I went over it with my dad to verify that there was not any offending terms, down to the details of using the word "you" and replacing it with "the points you gave me". They responded with an offensive attitude about "that list wasn't why i hate men". I apologize and ask for the real list, and they respond with "that's a whole mother topic and list i'm too lazy to write at the moment". [The whole conversation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/106F25XCSgbe2bYPB3pqtC9ZAw5ZUBdhU/view?usp=sharing), [first points](https://drive.google.com/file/d/105sfmMTepHlGsdL2b4vPcMT15Hjshn77/view?usp=sharing), [second points](https://drive.google.com/file/d/102xXOE_I6L8U4M5M50eM6xORCEiCENig/view?usp=sharing), [third point](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10-Yk3XUPtx8xkgC9sz0XvKsLL1PgUJLQ/view?usp=sharing).

This occured this Friday and during the weekend.
In Discord you can have 'roles' which represent what status the person is in the server.
Jokingly, Edward wanted his own custom role, he continued to ask until I gave in with an exception: he needed to chop down enough wood to fill an entire large chest, and fair enough, [he did it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vbH16x0L7GIiHg4LHnbkYywSV2XO7wAw/view?usp=sharing). He wanted the role to be named "Professional Retard", which of course he wanted it in a joking manner and he did not use this as a reason to self-deprecate. Later on, Mackenzie noticed that he had the role including that 'slur', they accordingly told me to change it and I declined because he requested it. After repetitive denying for the role name to be changed, they leave the server. I then go to their direct messages to talk with them. Their arguments were that "no one wants me there anyway" and "so i couldn’t get my way anyway", but mainly they come to the point that "so i don’t wanna be there if they’re saying words like that ok?" and I acknowledge. I come to say that most of society is like this and there will always be people using these words like this, it is almost required to not be offended by something as relatively small like this. We come to argue about the definitions of words while I try to prove that the fact that it is titled a slur doesn't mean it is to be avoided of:

Originally the Hard R word just referred to black people in the slavery times of America, eventually people started using it in a derogatory way to give it offense, now it's an offensive way to address or state a black person; and the same process for the word "retard".

I try telling them this but they still complain about it, and then I ask why would I change what one person has just because it offends you. "there isn't anybody here with any medical or mental conditions to get offended." and "besides it's not like there is anyone here that doesn't use slurs. there is no reason to get offended for ppl that are not here", I say.


To clarify, the fact that it is a 'slur' bothers them, if 'retard' was still as generically used as cancer in the same context/manner, cancer would be a 'slur', therefore in that alternate universe, if Edward wanted the role name to be "Professional Cancer Patient" Mackenzie would be just as offended; they do use generic slurs as their friends do with and against them, usually in a joking matter, but I guess that doesn't really count as a factor now.

I come back to [give them what I think is advice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GGXgLuWmY_N0KsEJCuenDKbPbKjPI1U8/view?usp=sharing).

I want to clarify what a 'good' person is to me:
A 'good' person is good not when they only do the good thing all the time, but when they do the good thing when it is inconvenient or uncomfortable for them, even when nobody is looking. However, it is inevitable that a person will make mistakes or be forced to choose between two bad choices.
A good person is not a perfect person, nor vice versa; a perfect person is impossible.

people pursue their own self interests at the cost of everyone else

not everyone noah

not everyone 

I hope I'm wrong

But I have yet to find that I am



Assumption to categorize a person as a 'good' person is hard because you will never know what they do in the shadows. There are few ways to find out, but all disinclude the person claiming themselves as 'good', in which the person is hypocritical without a doubt: out for themselves for the title of 'good'.


Since you're the english teacher, I ask what does a slur mean to you, I am no expert but I want to know if I am mixing something up.

My final request is this:
Since I cannot talk to them, I ask that you talk to them for me and ask what their stand is, as much time as they need but just in time before I leave campus for virtual (~1.5 weeks). 
If you need a confronting start about it, you can use "So Noah was talking to me about the Transphobia problem and what not, I wanna hear your sides of the problem", or in the same idea.

I want to actually sort this out because for one I cannot go one day sick in my liver thinking about this problem.

The people you want to talk this with about: Gigi, Mackenzie, Jaden, and Alice. Rylee and Heydren were also supporting them but weren't necessarily in the argument, I would still ask them for their opinion but I wouldn't think that they would have a lot to say since they were backed by them, likely just agreeing with the others.

And thank you, I appreciate you willing to help me (or soon them) about the problem, I cannot express how thankful I am for this chance.
